            <p> In 1947, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), 
                a banker in Maine, is convicted of murdering
                 his wife and her lover, a golf pro. Since the 
                 state of Maine has no death penalty, he is given
                  two consecutive life sentences and sent to the
                   notoriously harsh Shawshank Prison.</p>
